\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}

\item In the next decade, the number of connected devices is expected to 
increase 100 times and the data volume by 1000 times

\item Operators are already facing significant power bills

\item Moving towards green communications is important both for 
\textbf{environmental} and \textbf{economic} reasons

\frametitle{Harvesting renewable energy resources}
In order to power the Base Stations (BS), energy can be obtained from renewable 
sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural sources: Sun, wind, vibration
\item External: Batteries, fuel cells
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{%
Solar energy has been tested to power BS installed in road lamps, with the solar
panel on top [175]. It has been observed that it can run fully autonomous, with
the exception of the January month, where external power was needed.

Other sources of energy may not be so profitable, as sun is the source with the
higest amount of power, about \SI{100}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}, 
followed by the wind with \SI{12}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}.

\frametitle{Sugar bio-batteries [183]}

\begin{itemize}

	\item The typical density of energy of a Lithium cell is around 
	\SI{0.54}{\mega\joule\per\kilogram}

	\item But the combustion energy of glucose can release up to 
	\SI{15.5}{\mega\joule\per\kilogram}

	\item Sugars are non toxic, safe and carbon neutral
