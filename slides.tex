increase 100 times and the data volume by 1000 times

	\frametitle{Data traffic Volumes}
    \begin{itemize}
\item Today: 2 billion mobile broadband subscriptions 
\item Exponential growth in the following years 
\item A factor of 1000x capacity demand in 2020 vs 2012
\item  
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{Data traffic volumes:
Today, there are over 2 billion mobile broadband subscriptions worldwide, a figure that has grown by 40 percent annually over the last six years.

Furthermore, forecasts predict that data traffic volumes will experience an exponential growth in the coming years [2], as illustrated in Fig. 1. For example, it can be seen that the data traffic volumes are expected to increase approximately 10
times between 2012 and 2018 Predictions are made that per-user data rates are expected to grow by a factor of up to 50-100; on the other hand, the density of mobile Internet users is expected to increase by a factor of up to 10, implying a factor of 1000x capacity demand in the 2020 time frame
Hence, it is obvious that mobile systems in the future need to be capable of delivering significantly more capacity than today. 

In fact, up to now mobile networks were dimensioned by taking into account the peak
capacity. With this approach, the exponential growth rate will imply a costly network deployment. Instead, evolved mobile networks should satisfy the increasing traffic demand by a flexible availability of capacity (in time and space) in order to sustain the data rate development that has been observed during recent decades}

\note{
Today, there are almost 7 billion mobile subscriptions, and thereby wireless connected devices, worldwide.

However, in the future, this is predicted to change, as different kinds of machines such as smart grid devices, sensors and surveillance cameras will be connected to the networks. 

This is usually referred to as Internet-of-things [3] or machine-to-machine (M2M)
communication, and means that everything that can benefit from a wireless connection will have a wireless connection

\begin{itemize}

	\item The base station is the most power intensive element (more than 50\%).
	\item Also the usual lifetime is around 10--15 years, while smartphones is only 2.
	\item By reducing the power consumption of the largest element, the whole 
	consumption is reduced.

\frametitle{Harvesting renewable energy resources}
In order to power the Base Stations (BS), energy can be obtained from renewable 
sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural sources: Sun, wind, vibration
\item External: Batteries, fuel cells
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{%
Solar energy has been studied in UK cities, in order to power BS installed in 
road lamps, with a solar panel on top [175]. It has been observed that it can 
run fully autonomous, with the exception of the January month, where external 
power was needed.

Other sources of energy may not be so profitable, as sun is the source with the
highest amount of power, about \SI{100}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}, 
followed by the wind with \SI{12}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}.

	\item The typical density of energy of a Lithium cell is around

	\item But the combustion energy of glucose can release up to 
	\SI{15.5}{\mega\joule\per\kilogram}

\note{
The energy per Kilogram stored in a lithium cell is about 2 orders of magnitude below the available energy in an equivalent sized glucose cell.


Those cells are able to work for long periods with a suitable flow of glucose-like input stream. The enzymes used for the transformation of sugar are non toxic, an easy to obtain, they don't need any exotic metal nor element.

Experiments with bio-batteries seem to have a suitable position as power cells.

The cells consist of some enzymes placed close to an electrode. A

\frametitle{Energy efficiency metrics [179]}

\begin{itemize}

	\item We need some way to compare energy efficiency (EE), but which metric is 
more suitable?
	\item Output energy/input energy?
	\item Performance/energy consumption?
	\item What load should we use for the measurement?
	\item Accuracy?

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
In order to obtain an meaningful comparison of different technologies used in 
electronic communications, some metrics should be established so we can compare 
the energy efficiency.

Some candidates as the output power by the input power are useful when we can 
measure the power, but some times other measurements are more interesting. For 
example if we look at a processing unit, we may be interested in the performance 
per watt.

The base stations can operate at different loads, and the metric should include 
information of the load to be compared. Also the accuracy of the metric should 
be taken into consideration, as it may include information of fluctuations when 
the system is under operation.

We will focus on the metrics used at different levels of abstraction, starting 
from the lowest part, the component level, to the uppermost, the network level.

	\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{ee-component.png}
	\end{center}
	\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}

	\item The components are analyzed by parts
	\item Example: The efficiency of the antenna as the input power that it 
receives compared with the irradiated power.
	\item On the baseband processor, EE is measured as performance per unit of 
energy consumption.
	\item For the power supply, output power/input power, often higher than 
85\%

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
A general model is commonly used, as the one in the figure, to understand the 
different parts of a system. In each part we can identify and measure the 
efficiency based on specific metrics.

In the case of a radio base station, which may include one or more antennas, the 
efficiency can be expressed as the ratio of the radiated power $P_r$ to the 
input power $P_i$, $$ \eta = P_r / P_i$$

Whereas, in a baseband processor we are interested in the performance per watt, 
which can be measured by means of MFLOPS or MIPS which often can be expressed in 
equivalent MOPS (millions of operations per second).

The power supply is normally measured in terms of electrical efficiency, with 
the ration of output power by input power, often higher than 85\%.
