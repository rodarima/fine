\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}

\item In the next decade, the number of connected devices is expected to 
increase 100 times and the data volume by 1000 times

\item Operators are already facing significant power bills

\item Moving towards green communications is important both for 
\textbf{environmental} and \textbf{economic} reasons

\frametitle{Harvesting renewable energy resources}
In order to power the Base Stations (BS), energy can be obtained from renewable 
sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural sources: Sun, wind, vibration
\item External: Batteries, fuel cells
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{%
Solar energy has been studied in UK cities, in order to power BS installed in 
road lamps, with a solar panel on top [175]. It has been observed that it can 
run fully autonomous, with the exception of the January month, where external 
power was needed.

Other sources of energy may not be so profitable, as sun is the source with the
highest amount of power, about \SI{100}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}, 
followed by the wind with \SI{12}{\milli\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Bursty traffic cause devices to change state between idle and 
		connected with the associate \textbf{power consumption}
		\item Significant \textbf{overhead} with small packets
		\item Contention based method have been proposed

\frametitle{Sugar bio-batteries [183]}

\begin{itemize}

	\item The typical density of energy of a Lithium cell is around 
	\SI{0.54}{\mega\joule\per\kilogram}

	\item But the combustion energy of glucose can release up to 
	\SI{15.5}{\mega\joule\per\kilogram}

	\item Sugars are non toxic, safe and carbon neutral

	\begin{center}

	\end{center}

\begin{itemize}

	\item The base station is the most power intensive element (more than 50\%).
	\item Also the usual lifetime is around 10--15 years, while smartphones is 2.
	\item By reducing the power consumption of the largest element, the whole 
	consumption is reduced.
